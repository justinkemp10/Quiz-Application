# Quiz-Application

## The Task ##

Build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions using Javascript fundamentals. The app should run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

## Acceptance Criteria ##

1. When you start the quiz a timer starts and the user is presented with a question.
2. If the user answers incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.
3. When all questions are answered, or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over.
4. When the game has finished, the user can save their inititals and score.

## Mock-Up ##

The following animation is a demonstration of the application's functionality:
